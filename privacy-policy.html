      <address>
        Resource Air Charter<br />691 Fitzhugh Blvd Smyrna <br />37167 -
        Tennessee , USA<br />6152789450
      </address>

      <p>
        It is Resource Air Charter's policy to respect your privacy regarding
        any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
        Policy applies to
        <a href="http://resourceaircharter.com">resourceaircharter.com</a>
        (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "resourceaircharter.com"). We respect your
        privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
        information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this
        privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be
        collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
        circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This
        Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the
        Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other
        sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on
        our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use
        of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website,
        you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, Resource Air Charter collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. Resource Air Charter's purpose in collecting non-personally
        identifying information is to better understand how Resource Air
        Charter's visitors use its website. From time to time, Resource Air
        Charter may release non-personally-identifying information in the
        aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
        website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resource Air Charter also collects potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
        and for users leaving comments on http://resourceaircharter.com blog
        posts. Resource Air Charter only discloses logged in user and commenter
        IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below.
      </p>

      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to Resource Air Charter's websites choose to interact
        with Resource Air Charter in ways that require Resource Air Charter to
        gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
        information that Resource Air Charter gathers depends on the nature of
        the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
        http://resourceaircharter.com to provide a username and email address.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
        remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>Advertisements</h2>
      <p>
        Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
        partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
        recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement
        to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
        information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
        advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
        Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Resource Air Charter and
        does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
      </p>

      <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
      <p>
        Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by
        us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that
        third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
        and terms and conditions of every site you visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
        privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
        services.
      </p>

      <h2>Resourceaircharter.com uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
      <p>
        Resourceaircharter.com uses the remarketing services to advertise on
        third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our
        site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't
        completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make
        an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google
        search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network.
        Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on
        someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in
        accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the
        Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of
        interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently
        using a browser plugin.
      </p>

      <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        Resource Air Charter may collect statistics about the behavior of
        visitors to its website. Resource Air Charter may display this
        information publicly or provide it to others. However, Resource Air
        Charter does not disclose your personally-identifying information.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        To enrich and perfect your online experience, Resource Air Charter uses
        "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to
        display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your
        preferences on your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
        computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each
        time the visitor returns. Resource Air Charter uses cookies to help
        Resource Air Charter identify and track visitors, their usage of
        http://resourceaircharter.com, and their website access preferences.
        Resource Air Charter visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
        their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using

        of Resource Air Charter's websites may not function properly without the
        aid of cookies.
      </p>
